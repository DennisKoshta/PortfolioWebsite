# Computer Science Major Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website! Here you can find my resume, as well as a few projects that demonstrate my skills in software engineering and machine learning. In this repository, you will find the source code and documentation for the wesite and projects.

1. Hand Motion Tracking
2. Actor Degrees of Separation
3. JavaScript Drawing Canvas

## 1. Hand Motion Tracking

This project utilizes the MediaPipe NodeJS package to track and graphically visualize your hands and fingers using your webcam. It's an interesting way to explore computer vision and machine learning capabilities.

### Features

- Real-time hand tracking
- Graphical visualization of hands and fingers
- Easy to use interface

### Technologies Used

- NodeJS
- MediaPipe

## 2. Actor Degrees of Separation

This C++ program computes the shortest path between two actors in terms of degrees of separation using their movie appearances as connections. The program takes a formatted input text file containing actor pairs and outputs the corresponding movie/actor connections in a separate output file. The C++ code is optimized using an adjacency list data structure and BFS to find the shortest path efficiently.

### Features

- Compute the shortest path between two actors
- Efficient performance using BFS and adjacency list
- Customizable input and output files

### Technologies Used

- C++
- BFS Algorithm
- Adjacency List Data Structure

## 3. JavaScript Drawing Canvas

A simple canvas to draw and create whatever you desire. This project is made using JavaScript and allows users to unleash their creativity on the web.

### Features

- Draw with different colors and brush sizes
- Clear the canvas
- Draw fractal tree stamp
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface

### Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- HTML5 Canvas
